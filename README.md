# Plant-disease-prediction-using-images-and-convolutional-Neural-Network

This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of plants based on disease presence. By training on a labeled dataset of plant images, the model learns to identify specific diseases in plants, providing a valuable tool for agricultural diagnostics and monitoring.

## Overview
This project involves the creation of an image classification model that identifies plant diseases based on images. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning network particularly effective in image recognition tasks. The goal is to accurately classify images into healthy and diseased categories.

### Key Techniques
-  **Image Classification:** Using CNNs to identify plant diseases from images.
-  **Deep Learning with PyTorch:** Built using PyTorch for flexibility and GPU support.
-  **Data Preprocessing:** Image transformations and normalization to improve model performance.

### Features
-  **End-to-End Pipeline:** Covers steps from image preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- **Data Augmentation:** Applies transformations to improve model generalization.
- **GPU Acceleration:** Utilizes GPU for faster training on large datasets.
-  **Metrics and Evaluation:** Supports accuracy and loss metrics to assess model performance.
